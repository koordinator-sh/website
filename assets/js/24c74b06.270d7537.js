We have shown through experiments that Koordinator's fine-grained CPU scheduling capability can effectively suppress the competition for CPU resources and improve application performance."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0},9845:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/qos-cpu-orchestration-460f5568c67508e791d2f0b8798ac826.png"}}]);
